# UW Product Management Website Redesign

Welcome to the UW Product Management Club's website redesign project!

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local desktop:  
`git clone https://github.com/UWPM/website-v3.0.git`

1. Navigate to the project directory:  
`cd website-v3.0`

1. Install dependencies using npm:  
`npm install`
